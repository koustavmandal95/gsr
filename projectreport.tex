\section{Introduction}
This project deals with classification of garbage into various caterories using the software tensor.
Along with a learn and repeat system. Upon detection of the garbage it will send a signal to the house-keeping authorities. Hence the main feature of our robot is an onboard video camera. Also the robot must be compact and self contained in the sense it must have an onboard battery pack and wireless interface to the human controller.
