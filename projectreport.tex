\section{Abstract}
 {
The main objective of the project is to detect garbage sites in Pes University and alert the house-keeping authorities.The main feature of our robot is an onboard video camera.
The main control unit of this robot is raspberry pi 3 with wifi module and a remote control .

 }
\section{Introduction}
This project deals with classification of garbage into various caterories using the software tensor.
Along with a learn and repeat system. Upon detection of the garbage it will send a signal to the house-keeping authorities. Hence the main feature of our robot is an onboard video camera. Also the robot must be compact and self contained in the sense it must have an onboard battery pack and wireless interface to the human controller.

		User requirement:\newline
		Should \newline
		
		1. Survey a distance of 200m in about 15 min \newline
		
		2. Complete at least 4 round-trips before being recharged \newline
		
		Technical requirement:\newline
		
		Distance between the two points = 200m \newline
		Assuming it stops every 3m to capture an image of its surroundings and takes 5s to capture and process the image, the time taken to traverse the path = 4 min\newline
		Or an average speed of approximately 75 cm/s\newline
		
		Robot includes\newline
		4 DC motors with gearboxes = 4 * 180 gm = 720 gm [1] \newline
		4 wheels = 120 gm [2]
		chassis = 250 gm [2]  
		Raspberry Pi 3 model B (with wifi capability) = 45 gm
		Assume total battery weight = 250 gm [3] 
		Miscellaneous = 100 gm
		
		Total = approx 1500 gm \newline
		
		Power and Torque (Detailed calculations with comments in SpecsCalculator.m) \newline
		
		With a maximum angle of inclination = . degrees and rolling friction coefficient = 0.05
		
		Top Speed = 75 cm/s \newline
